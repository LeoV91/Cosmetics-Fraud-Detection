# Payment Card Fraud Detection

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a comprehensive approach to detecting fraudulent transactions in the luxury cosmetics sector. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, handling class imbalance, and training multiple machine learning models. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions effectively while minimizing false positives and negatives.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Card Fraud Detection in Luxury Retail Analytics Dataset, available on Kaggle:
 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratyushpuri/payment-card-fraud-detection-with-ml-models-2025

Overview
- Records: 2,133 transactions
- Features: 16 columns
- Target Variable: Fraud_Flag (binary classification: Fraud vs. Non-Fraud)
- Time Period: February 2025 â€“ August 2025 (6 months)
- Coverage: 20 luxury retail locations worldwide
- Industry Focus: High-end cosmetics and beauty products
- Notes: Includes intentionally inserted null values to simulate real-world data cleaning scenarios.

This dataset is synthetic but curated to reflect realistic fraud detection challenges in luxury retail.

## Key Features

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Initial inspection of the dataset, including data types, missing values, and distributions of key features.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creation of new features such as temporal attributes, high-cost purchase flags, and binary indicators for VIP customers.
   - Decomposition of complex fields like `Store_ID`, `Product_SKU`, and `IP_Address` into more granular components.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing values and ensuring consistent data types.
   - Standardizing column names for ease of use.

4. **Class Imbalance Handling**:
   - Oversampling the minority class (`fraud_flag`) to balance the dataset.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Training a variety of models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
   - Using a preprocessing pipeline with `StandardScaler` for numerical features and `TargetEncoder` for categorical features.
   - Evaluating models with accuracy and detailed classification reports.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Distribution plots for key features to understand data patterns.

## Results

- Ensemble models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy and recall, making them the most effective for fraud detection.
- Logistic Regression served as a reliable baseline, while KNN and SVM also performed competitively.

## Future Directions

- Hyperparameter optimization for the best-performing models.
- Exploration of advanced feature engineering and external data sources.
- Implementation of cost-sensitive modeling to account for the financial impact of misclassifications.
- Experimentation with time-series modeling and anomaly detection techniques.
